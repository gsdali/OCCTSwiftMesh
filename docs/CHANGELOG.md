## v1.1.0 — `Mesh.crossSection(plane:)` planar slicing

Adds a mesh **slicer**: intersect a mesh with a plane and recover the closed
contours where it cuts the surface — the perimeter step a 3D-printer slicer
performs. Pure geometry (no OCCT kernel calls), so it works directly on the
**open and unwelded** meshes that raw STL/scan bodies actually are, where sewing
to a B-Rep first would fail.

```swift
let section = mesh.crossSection(plane: CutPlane(point: p, normal: n))
// section.contours: closed loops, each classified by nesting:
//   depth 0 = outer solid boundary, depth 1 = a hole (inner wall / pocket), …
// A thin-walled tube → two separate loops; wall thickness = their offset.
let stack = mesh.crossSections(axis: axis, through: p, spacing: 2.0)  // slicer layer stack
```

- Intersection points welded by quantized world position (`weld:` tolerance,
  auto-derived from bbox), so coincident crossings chain even on unwelded STL.
- Inner-vs-outer comes from **contour nesting** (containment + signed area),
  not triangle winding — reliable on meshes with inconsistent orientation.
- Orientation normalized: even nesting depth CCW, odd CW.
- Open polylines (plane exits through a boundary edge) returned separately in
  `openPaths`.

New public types: `CutPlane`, `MeshContour`, `MeshCrossSection`.

## v1.0.0 — SemVer-stable

Promoted `Mesh.simplified(_:)` to a stable 1.0 line; pinned to OCCTSwift v1.0.1
(OCCT 8.0.0 GA). No API change from v0.1.0.

## v0.1.0 — `Mesh.simplified(_:)` via vendored meshoptimizer

Initial release. QEM mesh decimation backed by [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) v1.1 (MIT, vendored under `Sources/OCCTMeshOptimizer/src/meshoptimizer/`).

Requires OCCTSwift v0.156.2 or later (public `Mesh(vertices:normals:indices:)` initializer from [OCCTSwift#94](https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwift/issues/94)).

```swift
let result = mesh.simplified(.init(targetTriangleCount: 5_000))
// → SimplifiedMesh(mesh:, beforeTriangleCount:, afterTriangleCount:, hausdorffDistance:)
```

Validation:

- `targetTriangleCount` and `targetReduction` are mutually exclusive; one must be set.
- `targetTriangleCount` must be in `[1, input.triangleCount]`.
- `targetReduction` must be in `[0.0, 1.0]`.
- `maxHausdorffDistance`, when set, must be `>= 0`.
- Empty input meshes are rejected.

Bridge ABI (`Sources/OCCTMeshOptimizer/include/OCCTMeshOptimizer.h`):

- `OCCTMeshSimplify(...)` — runs the QEM pass, compacts orphan vertices via meshoptimizer's fetch remap, reports absolute Hausdorff distance.
- `OCCTMeshSimplifyFreeResult(...)` — releases caller-owned output buffers.
- `OCCTMeshSimplifyScale(...)` — exposes meshoptimizer's bbox-diagonal scale factor for callers that work in relative error units.
